<hr>

<h1 class="sec-header">The Approach</h1>
<hr>

<div style="font-size: 12pt;">
For the purpose of this project the robot will be a miniature one. The demo will be carried out on an A1 paper map; all the debris will be scaled to size to simulate the operation. Our robot will identify and mark all the debris on the map in the GUI system.

The project team has the ability to carry out all its operations automatically but due to safety requirements the robot will be operated under the operator’s supervision.

The robot system is divided into five main areas namely:

Robot Controllers:
• This system is responsible for providing a high level interface to the robot and its data.
• Explorer Carries out the exploration of the map and marks the no go zone.
• Pathfinder generally moves the robot between known points on the map.


GUI:
• GUIView displaces the model data.
• GUIController generally provides the user-interface controls.

Model:
• Model contains the model
• Ranger detects obstacles from Robot SA’s ultrasonic sensors.

Data Access:
Solely responsible for writing and reading the systems knowledge and converting them to XML files.

Robot:
The finished product, generally responds to commands from the RobotController, returns data from sensors to the GUI.
