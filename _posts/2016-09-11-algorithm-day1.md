It is the first day to pick up the algorithm after the graduation. After the interview with Google, I realized the importance of the algorithm and how it works in our daily coding. In order to have systematic learning of the algorithm. I have made a plan for it. In the begining, I will get through the basic data structure, such as list, tree, graph. After that, I will move to some popular algorithm. In the last stage, I will do the exercies on the Leetcode. As we are known, practice makes things better. During the exercises, you will find which aspect of knowledge is missing and you can put more focus on it.
