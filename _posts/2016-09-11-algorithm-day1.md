It is the first day to pick up the algorithm after I got my master degree. After the interview with Google, I realized the importance of the algorithm and how it works in our daily coding. In order to have systematic learning of the algorithm, I have made a plan for it. In the begining, I will get through the basic data structure, such as list, tree, graph, and etc. After that, I will move to some classical sort algorithm. In the last stage, I will use the exercies on the Leetcode to evaluate the ability to use existed algorithm solve the real problems. As we are known, practice makes things better. I believe that through the bunch of exercises I could find which aspect of knowledge is missing and I can put more effort on it.
