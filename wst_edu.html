		The game is called Super Sort that is expected to help raise awareness about the sustainable waste management system introduced by the Ecoversity team at the University of Adelaide. After the initial trial of the Web based game, we have started our journey of migrating the game to Android and iOS platforms. We are reaching close to a stage of releasing the Android version through Google play, after which the game will be migrated to iOS platform for distribution through Apple Store. We are looking for more partners to enhance and use the game in different contexts with different categories of audiences ranging from school kids to corporate workers â€“ Gamification for sustainability.
